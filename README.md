This is a social media site built with Zend Framework. It is 1 of my previous big projects that had been developed and maintained for over 2 years.

The main works include basic OAuth integration (facebook, google, twitter), integrating Google Map geolocation feature into the site, building the search filter and search result to interact with the selected map radius and marker location, and showing the activity feed on user profile page.
